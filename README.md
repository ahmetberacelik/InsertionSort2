# Insertion Sort Implementation in C

This C program takes 5 numbers from the user, sorts them, and then prints the sorted version to the screen. The sorting algorithm used is "Insertion Sort".

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted with "Please enter 5 numbers: ".
2. The user inputs 5 numbers.
3. These numbers are sorted using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
4. The sorted numbers are printed to the screen.

## Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion Sort works by taking each element to be sorted, one at a time, and inserting it into its correct position within a sorted array. It takes an element, places it in the appropriate place within the sorted part of the array, and shifts the remaining elements to create space for the new element.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the code: [insertion_sort.c](insertion_sort.c)
2. Compile the code: `gcc insertion_sort.c -o insertion_sort`
3. Run the program: `./insertion_sort`
4. Follow the prompts in the console to input 5 numbers.
5. The program will print the sorted numbers to the screen.

## Points to Note

- This program is written in the C language.
- The program expects exactly 5 numbers as input from the user. If the user provides a different number of inputs, unexpected behavior may occur.
- Ensure that inputs from the user are valid numbers. Invalid inputs may cause the program to behave unexpectedly.
- This program is designed for those who have a basic understanding of the C language. Refer to the documentation for more information on the C language.
